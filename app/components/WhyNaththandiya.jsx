              The recent disaster in the Naththandiya area of Chilaw has left thousands of 
              families struggling to rebuild their lives. Children have lost not just their homes, 
              but also their school supplies, books, and the basic tools they need for education.

              Education is more than just learning—it's hope, normalcy, and a path forward. 
              For these 3,500 children, returning to school means returning to a sense of 
              stability and routine in the midst of chaos.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Many families are facing impossible choices between meeting basic needs and 
              providing school supplies. No child should have to miss out on education because 
              of circumstances beyond their control.

              By focusing our efforts on Naththandiya, we can make a concentrated, meaningful 
              impact on an entire community. Together, we can ensure every child has what they 
              need to continue their education and build a brighter future.
